# Python

## Background

This section provides a "zero-to-hero" python course complete with tutorials, interactive exercises, and projects.

All exercises and projects are graded via test scripts within this repository.

## Running Test Scripts

- For all exercises in this tutorial, test scripts will be provided in the `/tests` subdirectory
- DO NOT MODIFY THE TESTS
- You can, however, look at the test files to see what the tests expect, if that is helpful
- To run the tests, simply run the `run_tests.sh` script in the root directory of each section

For example, we can run all tests in the `00_Introduction` directory:

```
\developer-qual\python> ./00_Introduction/run_tests.sh
```
