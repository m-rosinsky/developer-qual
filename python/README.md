# Python

## Background

This section provides a "zero-to-hero" python course complete with tutorials, interactive exercises, and projects.

All exercises and projects are graded via test scripts within this repository.

## Running Test Scripts

- For all exercises in this tutorial, test scripts will be provided in the `/tests` subdirectory.
- DO NOT MODIFY THE TESTS
- To run the tests, simply run the `test.py` script in the `/tests` directory using python3

For example, we can run the tests for the exercises in the introduction section with the following command:

```
\developer-qual\python> python3 00_Introduction\tests\test.py
```
